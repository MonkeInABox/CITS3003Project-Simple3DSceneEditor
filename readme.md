# CITS3003 Project

### Jeremy Butson (23390554) & Jasper Chadwick (23831346)

## Building

Operating system: Linux

 - tested and developed on Arch Linux and Nobara Linux
 - it does also build on windows, but no guarentees it will work fully

build commands should be the same as the template

we also used the `ImGuiFileDialog` library which we have included in the ./lib/ directory.
we used it because we didn't realise that the project already had the tinyfiledialogs library
